# What is this?
This is a Python package that automatically analyses and make sense any data you may have. The current methods are:
- Graphing variables against a result variable
- Graphing each variable with the threshold of a result variable
- Showing the prediction accuracies of each variable on a result variable

# How does it work?
A graphical user interface allows the user to open an Excel spreadsheet in a particular format, then they can select multiple variables and 1 result variable, then select the options to analyse the data.

# What is the Excel spreadsheet format?
A spreadsheet containing one table, with the first row as the header row, and each subsequent row being an entry of data. No index columns.
